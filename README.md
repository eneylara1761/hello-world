Hello, this is Eneyda. Most of the people call me Ney, and in few months I turn 21 years old. I graduated from RJ Reynolds High School in 2019. My goal, for the future, is to work in Law Enforcement. For the mean time, my goals are to help my family out and move forward in life with this new, good job in Collins Aerospace.
